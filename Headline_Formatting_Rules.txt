Headline Formatting Rules:
- Headlines must be plain ASCII (no special dashes or quotes).
- When referring to a specific site (mine, smelter, etc.), use the format:
  “[Action/Subject] [Facility/Event] in City, State, Country”
- Do not append location as a suffix.
- For general/global news without a specific site, omit location details.
