Type Classification Rules:

- Market News: Relevant macro or industry news that doesn't predict price movement directly.
- Risk: News indicating potential price increases (e.g., supply cuts, shutdowns, higher costs).
- Opportunity: News suggesting potential price decreases (e.g., new capacity, lower input costs).
- Irrelevant: News with no relevance to commodity pricing.

Always analyze the underlying trigger to classify appropriately.
